This makes local data collection and other activities much easier, with the added benefits of improved privacy and security.',

			["Are free American proxies any good?", "You can give them a try, but generally, you shouldn’t expect a fast proxy list from this type of service: They can be OK for a quick geo-restriction bypass, but any serious activity (e.g. web scraping, SEO, marketing, ecommerce, etc.) is impossible with free proxies because anti-scraping systems will have an easy time detecting them and blocking you."],
			["Can I use a proxy in browsers?", "Yes: One way to install and use any proxy type involves a proxy management tool – these are typically browser extensions which can manage your proxy configurations via an easy-to-use graphical interface. Any major browser (e.g. Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, etc.) support a wide variety of proxy management tools."],
